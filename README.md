# VBA_Invoice_Generator_Tool
The aim of this tool is to automate the invoice generation procedure and keep an overview of the status of all invoices in one place.
This tool makes creating invoices a pleasant admin task. It no longer takes 20-30 minutes per invoice but instead just a few clicks that takes 2-3 minutes.

Having the information for all the invoices in one place, allows you to keep an eye on jobs completed, open invoices and money made.
